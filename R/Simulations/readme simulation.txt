This folder conatins scipts used for the simulation studies in the paper.

The two subfolders contains the scripts and results from the two simulation studies. 

The scripts are marked with h0 for the first simulation study, where the two groups 
share the same parameters (ie a null hypothesis situation). The scripts marked
with h1 are for the second study, where there were some differences between the groups.


The suffixes (eg n150) indicates the sample sizes used in the studies. 


The files sim_seeds_[1-8].txt contains the seeds used in the simulations. You can see
in each script which file is loaded.
